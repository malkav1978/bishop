# Bishop

Bishop is a C++ client library for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) open-source monitoring system.

## Why Bishop?

Whe searching Prometheus on the internet, the first results were related to Ridley Scott's movie, Prometheus.

When the idea to create my own client library came to me, I first thought of Ash, the android from the original Alien movie. But I also thought of Bishop in Cameron's sequel, who played a similar role but remained loyal to the Sulaco crew, unlike Ash. So, Bishop's goal is to provide a helpful solution to analyze the behavior of your applications.

And it might remain loyal to your crew.
